# README for Star Tracking With an Event Camera:

This Code uses a DAVIS Event Camera to track stars in the night sky, and through this track movement of the camera between frames (and thus the moevement of whatever the camera is attached to).

It can produce both the stars colour-coded as they move across the camera's field of view, as well as a 3D visualisation of the camera as a rectangle, rotating in real time in the same direction as the camera.

### Required Libraries:
JAER (https://github.com/SensorsINI/jaer), this whole code was built on top of this library so that it could use the inbuilt classes for dealing with the event camera and events

OpenCV(https://opencv.org/)

Java3D(http://www.java3d.org/)

KDTree for Java(https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/de.biomedical-imaging.edu.wlu.cs.levy.cg/kdtree/1.0.3)

Efficient Java Matrix Library (http://ejml.org/)

### To Run:
Run the code as is, and also open a JAER viewer. The camera input can be sent from the JAER Viewer to the this program through gping in JAER Viewer:

File -> Remote -> Enable Unicast Datagram (UDP) Output.

Should work as is, other than two DLL files which I'm currently manually importing at the start of StarTracking.Java, 
you should see 

"System.load("C:\\Users\\ryanj_000\\Documents\\HonoursCode\\starTrackingBuiltOnJAER2\\starTrackingBuiltOnJAER\\lib\\opencv_java320.dll");" and another similar line below it, both at the start of the main function
replace these absolute paths with their location on your computer. If it doesn't work try properly downloading the libraries and building them on your computer as opposed to using the files included in this code.
