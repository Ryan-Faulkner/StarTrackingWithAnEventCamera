        <h1> Integrate And Fire Toolbox </h1>
            This Package provides a set of classes with which you can build networks
            of integrate-and-fire neurons and use them in filters.
            <br/><br/>
            So, it's working in a very basic form right now.  To use it:
            <ul>
                <li>    
                    To Start: Get a piece of paper.  Write some numbers on it in marker.  
                    Move them slowly in front of the camera.  Currently works well with ~3cm 
                    tall numbers held at ~18 inches.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then, in filter "ClassItUp", click "Load_Network", and go to "JAER\Filter Settings\Neural Nets\P 784-10 91.1.txt"
                </li>
                <li>
                    The network will start guessing numbers that you hold up there.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            
            
            <br/><br/>
