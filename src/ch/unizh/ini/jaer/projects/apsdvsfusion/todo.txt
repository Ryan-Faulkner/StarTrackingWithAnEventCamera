ToDo:

1) Stackable maps:
  a) each map gets a list of input kernels and a list of output kernels
  b) expressionbasedkernel: only 1 activationmap
  c) size updates: each map needs to inform input and output kernels about size changes
  d) each map has property to add _input_kernel, also lists input kernels, not output kernels
  e) modify kernels in order to support even-sized kernels and larger output maps than input maps
  f) define 2 default input maps - on and off, main filter should simply cause spikes on these maps.
  g) 



1) Interface changes:
- Cell Model must be
  a) selectable (Integrate cell, IntegrateAndFire etc.)
  b) editable (like threshold, time constant etc.)
  
- Kernel Editor:
  a) improve output viewer
  b) fuse output viewer and kernel editor
  c) show formulas in output viewer, allow editing of instantiated kernels
  
  
- allow Spatio-Temporal Filters:
  a) Kernel Editor & viewer must allow 3D kernels
  b) new Cell model required:
     i)   current-based or voltage based (integrate charges or search for membrane potential peaks?)
     ii)  at each spike, a "future profile" should be added to the future voltage or current trace of affected cells. 
     iii) How to generate spikes? Future spikes can only be generated when the next spike arrives...
