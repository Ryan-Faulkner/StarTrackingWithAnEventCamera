  Classes related to monitoring address-events.
  <p>
  AEMonitorInterface defines the interface that a hardware device must have to deliver packets of AEs.
 <p>
Includes AEPacket, AEPacket2D for packets of events, and Event, EventRaw, and Event2D for grouping the quantities
  related to a particular event. For efficiency, packets of events do not use arrays of objects but rather, 
use multiple arrays, one for each e.g. x, y, type. The timestamps are stored in the basic AEPacket. Since arrays are fixed size,
 AEPacket classes have method ensureCapacity(n) to possibly enlarge these arrays (by copying to new ones). If the arrays in a new
 empty packet are created with a certain capacity, the producer must ensure they set the numEvents field to tell the receiver
 what are the valid data in the arrays.
