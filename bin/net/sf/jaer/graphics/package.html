            Rendering and diplaying address-events. These are separated broadly
            into classes that take AEPacket AE data and 'render' them to a memory buffer 
            and other classes that actually paint
            them to graphics hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
            The complexity of this class structure is due to the separation of 
            rendering from capture. AEViewer, for example,
            renders the data after calling the AEChipRenderer supplied with an AEPacket. 
            It then requests drawing through the ChipCanvas for the chip. This doesn't immediately draw the data, but
            ends up by the graphics system calling the display(GLAutoDrawable) of the canvas. The ChipCanvas then
            either draws the data rendered to float[][] arrays by the renderer, or directly draws the events
            through the AEChipRenderer, which maintains a reference to the last packet that it rendered.
        </p>
        <p>
            In each of the above cases, the data that is drawn 
            comes from the renderer object, not from the calling 
            main rendering loop, nor from the AEChip. The reason for this is that the Chip object
            doesn't maintain the volatile data - this job is left to the main rendering loop and viewer, which maintains
            the connection between chip object and hardware interface and which actually gets the data from 
            the hardware, from a log file, or from a network socket.
