  Classes related to remapping events from 
  sender to receiver. These are based on the 
  mapper interface developed
  by Adrian Whatley at the Inst. of Neuroinformatics for the Rome PCI-AER board.
  <p>
  A concrete implementation can be realized in software using a monitor/sequencer device
  by monitoring packets and remapping them out to the sequencer output, although this
  implementation will have significant latency and will have unpredicatable timing.
  <p>
      Classes in this package define two types of mappers, LUT-based and algorithmic. The LUT mapper
      uses memory to hold a hashtable that maps from source addresses to memory arrays of destination addresses.
      The algorithmic mapper maps from source addresses to arrays of destination addresses, but these mappings are
      computed algorithmically.
