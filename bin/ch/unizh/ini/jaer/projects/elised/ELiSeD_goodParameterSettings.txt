ELiSeD - Good Parameter Settings
********************************
For the reworked version, v.2.:

bufferSize: 		Between 2500 and 8000+, depending on the environment
				- Choose buffer higher for tracking, lower for best quality segments
				- buffer size estimator: see below

maxAge:/maxAgeGradientCalculation: 30000 to 50000; can be chosen huge (100000) as well
				for less good and bad segments. Maybe choose as a multiple 
				(1x, 2x) of oldest age among buffered pixels.

minLineSupport: 	12 to 15 looks ok

minNeighbors: 		1 (others not tested)

toleranceAngle: 	~ 23

splittingActive: 	true; can be set false if density criterion on and time is important

widthToSplit:		15 seems ok

mergeOnlyIfLinesAligned: true; see splittingActive, time influence not tested

maxDistance: 		not properly tested; 2.7 to 3.5 seems ok though

decayFactor: 		0.95 to 0.97; 0.96 seemed best

addOnlyIfDensityHigh: 	true (=density criterion)

orAddIfDensityIncreases: true! (if density criterion on; otherwise no effect)

minDensity:		0.8 to 0.95

minSupportForDensityTest: 7 worked fine; not properly tested (only a few values tried)

distinguishOpposingGradients: true; otherwise line quality decreases (at least they did
				so in the one scenery tested)
useWideSobelKernel: 	true! 

useTimestampGradient:	true, as it looks right now - false if maxAge cannot be chosen well

predictTimestamps:	undecided, doesn't seem to matter

(timestampIncludedInEachLog: False, likely. False: logging for sfm; true: logging for my R scripts.)

dynamicBuffer: 		depends on situation; try and see what is better


BufferSizeEstimator:
********************
maxSize: 		big enough, 20000 sure is enough

minSize: 		as small as possible, can be 0

estimatedAvOccupation: 	11-13, e.g for 'walk to kripa'; 13 better for tracking.

simple: 		true

minResizeDifference:	as resize doesn't seem costly, can be chosen already as e.g. 0.2 (but 
			better check for runtime differences if unsure)

storageTime:		20.000 seems ok. Same as minResizeDifference. (Don't choose one too high
			and wonder why the other parameter doesn't seem to have an influence.)
